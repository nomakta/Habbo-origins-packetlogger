# Habbo origins packetlogger
This projects makes you able to packetlog on habbo origins,

## Known-issues
Due to my lack of 'knowledge' on python this has just kind off been an thrown together project there are a few issues I'm still working on / planning to improve on.

  * Packets get combined on S2C or C2S
  * When you try to send data using S2C(Server to Client) or C2S(Server to client) it waits until new data gets recieved and after that it sends out the data



##Feel free to contribute
I'm planning on maintining this project, so if you have any contributions please feel free to commit them :)
